## Introduction
"Data enables us to understand the world around us. Whether we're gathering data about our natural world to understand how it is changing, or analyzing patterns in how societies grow and change to ensure we're supporting all people, data is what drives the conversation. In this one-day workshop, we invite you to take the first step to learning how to understand data. With the power of Python, you will be able to explore data more quickly and develop more complex learnings from that data with just a few lines of code. Step 1: Learn the basics of Python coding and understand how it can be used to digest large data sets.
