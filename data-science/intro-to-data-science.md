## Introduction
Every day new data is created. New parts are made and shipped from factories, people continuously tweet, and companies grow and fluctuate causing major changes in the market. With the addition of more data comes the difficulty of being able to process that data. As humans, we can understand complex scenarios, but computers are much better at being able to analyze large datasets. In this workshop, you will get a glimpse into how we can teach machines to analyze complex scenarios at a much larger scale than we're able to. After you've cleaned and organized your data, you will have an opportunity to train and test machine learning models, and even publish your predictor online for others to explore. 

## Metadata
Duration: 6 hours  

## Pre-requisites
You do not need any prior experience with data science to attend this workshop. You are likely someone who has ~1 year experience coding, preferrably in Python, but not a requirement. You are interested in learning how to use Python libraries to call machine learning models and make predictions on your data.

## Workshop requirements
You should have your own laptop (Windows or Mac) with an Internet browser. You will be using Azure Notebooks, a cloud-based Jupyter Notebooks instance, and Azure Machine Learning Studio. All you will need is a Microsoft Account, which only requires an email address and for which  you can sign up for at the event.

If you need a referesher on how to code in Python or work with NumPy or Pandas, we recommend you check out the materials from our other Reactor Wowrkshop:
